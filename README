reggatad --- is a daemon (service) process that's main purpose is to watch for changes in filesystem and update tags database correspondingly. Also it manages the tags database (SQLite?) and provides an API for all operations with tagged files. This API uses reggata_client.

It would use
- Flexc++ and Bisonc++ to implement query language parsing
- Embedded database, there are several options here:
    * RocksDB http://rocksdb.org/docs/getting-started.html C++ simple key value store
    * EJDB http://ejdb.org/doc/ql/ql.html C++ JSON database, very good query language, not maintained
    * LMDB https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database
    * SQLite
- POCO FileWatcher class (implemented with inotify on Linux)
- Boost for everything else

Repository should have a list of required fileds. Every file with tags should have these fields set. E.g. 'rating'

## API
### init_repo(path_to_root_dir)
### add_tags_to_file(file_path, tag1, tag2, ...)
### remove_tags_from_file(file_path, tag1, tag2, ...)
### add_fields_to_file(file_path, field1(key1,val1), field2(key2,val2), ...)
### remove_fields_from_file(file_path, field_key1, field_key2, ...)
### list_file_tags_fields(file_path)
### search(query_string)

## File watch actions
### file_created - do nothing
### file_removed - remove file tags and fields from DB
### file_moved (renamed) - update file path
### file_modified - do nothing
### dir_created - create a filewatch for it
### dir_removed - remove all files tags and fields from DB recursively. Remove filewathes from dir and subdirs
### dir_moved (renamed) - update files paths for all files recursively. Remove/Create a filewatcher for the dir

## Query String Language
### Examples:
tag1 | tag1 != NULL => all files with tag1
NOT tag1 | tag1 == NULL => all files without tag1

Fields are just tags with values. Values should be typed. Types supported are: string, number, datetime
Operations with tags are: AND, OR, NOT and braces
Operations with fields are: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, ~= (like)

t1 t2 t3 => files which has all three tags: t1 AND t2 AND t3
t1 t2|t3 => files with tag t1 AND any of t2 OR t3
(t1 t2)|t3 => files with tags t1 AND t2 OR just one tag t3
t1 f1>5 => files with tag t1 AND field f1>5

The obvious way of executing queries is just filter files by subdir (recursively), then iterate over them and 
apply query predicate to every file. Very often case is to perform a query in a subdir. The mechanism for executing 
query in the repo root is just a particular case of "exec query in subdir".
